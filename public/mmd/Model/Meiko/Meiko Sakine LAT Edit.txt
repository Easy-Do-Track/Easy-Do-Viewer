LAT Meiko Sakine Edit by Chee-shep on DeviantART.

Thanks for waiting for this model, despite the fact that I never gave any notice of releasing another edit. Please credit me when you use this model edit. If you want to edit her you can, but please still link back to me for the original model.

Now, you can give out edits if she's going to be in a completely different outfit, but please don't give out edits that are just adjustments to this model.
